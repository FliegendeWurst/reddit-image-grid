## Self-hosting

Run: `cargo install --git https://github.com/FliegendeWurst/reddit-image-grid`.

Set both `REDDIT_IMAGE_GRID_BASE_URL` (without trailing slash) and `REDDIT_IMAGE_GRID_PORT`, then run the `server` binary.

Example: 

```
REDDIT_IMAGE_GRID_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
REDDIT_IMAGE_GRID_PORT=8080
```

If you want to activate the "star" feature, set `REDDIT_IMAGE_GRID_DATABASE`. The server will create an SQLite database at the provided location.
